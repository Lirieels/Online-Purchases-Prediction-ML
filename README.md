The dataset is already preproccessed so there is no need for any preproccessing.

The dataset consists 18 columns, from which 10 are numerical and 8 are categorical. It has 12330 rows, where each row represents a different user and the actions that that user took. All the data on the dataset are collected in a year period.

The intention of this project is using the dataset to predict the online purchases that a user would make if he took different combination of actions.
